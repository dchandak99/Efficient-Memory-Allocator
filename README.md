# Efficient-Memory-Allocator

### Highlights:
- Designed a simulator for the efficient dynamic allocation of memory to a large number of processes
- Utilized the first-fit strategy to decide the locations at which memory should be allocated
- Requests included are A(Allocate) , D(Deallocate), H(stop), T(Terminate)


### Detailed Statement :

There are n processes and the system has a memory of size M, consisting of locations
with address 0 to M-1. A program may request to be allocated memory of size m,
and we have to allocate a set of m consecutive locations that are currently
not allocated to any program. If they are available, we should find the 
starting address of such a set of m locations, if not, the request
should be kept pending. A program may also request deallocation of memory
that was previously allocated to it. The starting address of the memory
to be deallocated will be given. You have to check that some amount of 
memory with that starting address was allocated to the program previously, and 
deallocate it. If the address is incorrect, you should indicate an error. A
program may also terminate, in which case all memory allocated to it is 
deallocated.  
  
Whenever memory is freed, you have to check if any pending requests for memory
can now be allocated, and if so do the allocation in the order in which the
requests were made. Note that when a program terminates, all memory
allocated to it must be freed, before considering pending requests.  
  
Different strategies are used for deciding the locations to allocate. The
simplest one is called the first-fit strategy, in which the smallest address
such that there exist required number of consecutive unallocated locations
starting from it, is allocated. Another is called the best fit strategy,
in which the starting address of a block of consecutive unallocated locations
of minimum size >= required number is allocated.   
  
I have implemented the first fit startegy  
  
Input Format  
The first line of input specifies n, the number of programs, and M the
number of memory locations. Assume 1 <= n <= 1000 and 1 <=  M <= 10^9.
The subsequent lines contain a description of the requests to the system.
Each request is of one of the following types:  
  
A pid size  
D pid address  
T pid  
H  
  
A pid size :  allocate size consecutive locations to program number pid.  
D pid address : deallocate memory allocated to program number pid at address.  
T pid : Terminate program pid and deallocate all memory allocated to it.  
H : halt the system.  
  
The sequence of requests will always terminate with H.  
  
Output Format  
For every request of type A, print out the address of the starting location
that is allocated. If the request is pending when the system halts, print -1.
For every D request, print out a 0 if it is a valid deallocation, else print
out a 1. For every T request, print out a 0 if some memory was currently
allocated to the program that terminated else print out a 1. Each output
should be printed on a separate line, in the order in which the requests
are made. Note that the order in which allocation is done may be different.
